# PVS: Photo Video Slideshow using HTML

Shows photos and/or video snippets using a web browser on your phone, tablet, computer, or TV.

Make a cheap photo/video display by gathering your home videos and/or photos onto a micro-SD card and plug it into a $50 (7"), $80 (8"), or $150 (10") Fire Tablet

Javascript reads in photo and video index files, then randomly displays photo and video snippets for 30 seconds.
Loads 100 random images at a time, reloads a new set every 30 minutes.
